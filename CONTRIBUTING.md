## Development Environment Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/anconina/deep-research.git`
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   cd deep-research
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

## Coding Guidelines

### Style Guide

* Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code
* Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for code formatting
* Use [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for import sorting
* Type annotations should be used for all public functions (using [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html))

### Testing

* Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
* Aim for high code coverage (at least 80%)
* Use pytest fixtures for test setup/teardown
* Mock external dependencies

### Documentation

* Update documentation for all new features
* Add docstrings to all public functions (Google style)
* Keep the README up-to-date

## Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* First line should be 50 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * üìù `:memo:` when adding or updating documentation
    * ‚ú® `:sparkles:` when adding a new feature
    * ‚ö°Ô∏è `:zap:` when improving performance
    * üß™ `:test_tube:` when adding tests

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the maintainer to merge it for you.

## Release Process

1. Update the CHANGELOG.md with the release notes
2. Update the version number in setup.py and pyproject.toml
3. Create a release on GitHub
4. The CI/CD pipeline will automatically build and publish the package to PyPI
